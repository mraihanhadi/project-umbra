  lore: Minato made his living by gambling, often hopping from table to table during
    his free time.  On several occasions, he was even expelled from casinos for almost
    going bankrupt. His personal code,  however, was to punish the greedy, help those
    in need, and never place a bet on a sure thing because,  really, where's the
    fun in that?
