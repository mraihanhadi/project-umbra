  lore: Initially a chore, helping out eventually turned into his favorite part of
    the day.  Since he had been helping his mother with the dishes since he was a
    teenager and had already advanced to  head chef by his twenties, Tsumasu found
    it easy to assume the role of heir to his family's restaurant chain.
