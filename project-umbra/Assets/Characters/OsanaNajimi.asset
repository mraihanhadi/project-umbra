  lore: As a top intelligence operative for the biggest spy agency in the world,
    Osana's hyper-adaptive abilities  make her an unmatched asset. Despite her disarming
    appearance, she has tricked many countries into unintentionally supporting her
    missions, always for the greater good  or to meet her agency's urgent needs.
