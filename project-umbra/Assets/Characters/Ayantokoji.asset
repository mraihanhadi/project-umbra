  lore: Ayanto no longer pretends to be moral. Raised in an environment of violence
    and corruption,  he took the lessons learned in his native nation, that wealth
    is more than just power to the correct conclusion.  By portraying himself as
    a living prophet who can channel the will of something much greater,  an invisible
    truth that speaks through the language of gold, debt, and desire,  he commands
    a passionate following that worships wealth as a sacred force.
