  lore: Growing up on the rough streets of O'Block, Jamal quickly became a street
    hustler YN and discovered that  being fearless, ruthless, and bold was necessary
    for survival. He is violent, cold, and unruly,  making him 90% bad. Even though
    women are aware that he is nothing more than trouble,  they are still drawn to
    him because of his smooth, lady-killer charm.
