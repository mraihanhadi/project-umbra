  lore: Kyouya is part of a mercenary group that a war-torn country has hired. He
    frequently acts as the  team's pointman or heavy weapons specialist due to his
    impressive physical strength and solid background in several martial arts. He
    has peculiarities, though, and most people  find it difficult to understand him
    because of his caveman-like speech. In spite of this,  Kyouya closely follows
    the rules of engagement and is incredibly devoted to his allies.
