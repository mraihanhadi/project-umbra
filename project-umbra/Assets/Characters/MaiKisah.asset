  lore: Chinatown's Madame Mai sells mystery by the minute, including fortune charms,
    face readings,  and ""ancient"" wisdom, all wrapped in silk and incense. It's
    all an act, but one that is profitable.  She simply knows how to read people,
    she doesn't believe a word of it. She keeps the hopeful interested  and the money
    coming in with her charm, theatrics, and just the right amount of mystery.  It's
    just business, nothing spiritual.
